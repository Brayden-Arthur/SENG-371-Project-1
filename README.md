# SENG-371-Project-1
Software 371 - Software (R)Evolution - This project will be an attempt to analyse if global market share(and company revenue) of smartphone developers has any impact on larger or smaller project releases

### Does the global market share of smartphones correlate with their project releases, further is there a trend such that the more revenue a specific company brings in, the shorter the time period in between their releases will be?

1. Collect data on user base using statistica, IDC, and other online data repositories.
2. Track companies market prices over time
3. Store data in standard txt files for easy input into R
4. separate points where other factors may have caused dips or spikes in share prices
5. Use R to see if resulting comparisons are statistically significant 
6. attempt to automate process and show where there may be spikes in the future

I will analyse the major smartphone developers Samsung, Apple, and Xiaomi (firefox os, windows phone, RIM are also possible sources of data)

* Data collection should be completed by February 7(steps 1, 2, and 3)
* Data separation should be completed by February 14(step 4)
* Statistic analysis should be completed by February 24(step 5)
* Project completion is estimated to be February 28
