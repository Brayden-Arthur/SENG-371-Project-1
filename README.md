## SENG-371-Project-1

### An analysis of brooks law/a look into how a new programmer working on a project might affect its evolution on github projects

Since my previous question was a bit too hard to accomplish I have set about on something I can hopefully accomplish

1.Using CodeAnalyzer/Gitstats to determine where there are expansions in a codebase based on lines of code/amounts of files
2.Using the github api to see where and when there have been pull requests as well as if they have been merged

revised project completion date: February 23
*trying to finish new data collection by 20th
*hopefully will be done analysis of data by sunday 22nd
*might have a day to try and automate it
